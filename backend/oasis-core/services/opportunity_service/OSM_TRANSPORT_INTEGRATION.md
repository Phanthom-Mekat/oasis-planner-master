# üöó OpenStreetMap Transport Network Integration

## ‚úÖ What's Been Added

Real transport access data from **OpenStreetMap** using OSMnx!

### How It Works

1. **Downloads** the actual road network for Dhaka from OpenStreetMap
2. **Analyzes** road density for each grid cell
3. **Calculates** transport access score (0-1) based on km of roads per km¬≤

### Road Density Calculation

```python
# For each grid cell:
- Find all roads that intersect the cell
- Calculate total road length in meters
- Calculate cell area in square meters
- Road density = length / area
- Normalize to 0-1 score (higher density = better access)
```

### Transport Score Interpretation

| Score | Road Density | Meaning |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Low | Poor road connectivity, transport deserts |
| 0.3 - 0.7 | Medium | Moderate road network |
| 0.7 - 1.0 | High | Dense road network, excellent transport access |

## üì¶ Installation

Already added to `requirements.txt`:

```bash
cd backend/oasis-core/services/opportunity_service
pip install osmnx==1.9.4 networkx==3.4.2 geopandas==1.0.1 shapely==2.0.6
```

## üî• Real Data Sources Now Active

| Data Layer | Source | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Housing Pressure** | NASA VNP46A3 Nighttime Lights | ‚úÖ REAL |
| **Food Access** | NASA MODIS Land Cover | ‚úÖ REAL |
| **Transport Access** | OpenStreetMap Network | ‚úÖ REAL |
| **Population** | Derived from Nighttime Lights | ‚úÖ REAL |

## üéØ Data Quality

### VNP46A3 (Nighttime Lights)
- **Resolution**: 15 arc-second (~500m at equator)
- **Temporal**: Monthly composites
- **Coverage**: Global

### MODIS MCD12Q1 (Land Cover)
- **Resolution**: 500m
- **Temporal**: Yearly (2024)
- **Classes**: 17 land cover types including cropland

### OpenStreetMap (Roads)
- **Resolution**: Vector (exact coordinates)
- **Temporal**: Real-time (current data)
- **Detail**: All road types (motorway, primary, secondary, residential, etc.)

## üöÄ Usage

Just restart the backend - OSM data will be downloaded automatically on first request:

```bash
cd backend/oasis-core
python start_services.py
```

## üí° Benefits

### Before (Estimated)
```python
transport_score = 0.5 + (housing_pressure * 0.4)
# Simple correlation with infrastructure
```

### After (Real OSM Data)
```python
transport_score = road_density / 0.008
# Actual road network analysis
# Identifies true transport deserts
```

## üîç What This Reveals

Real transport data can show:
- **Informal settlements** with high population but poor road access
- **Planned developments** with good road networks
- **Transit gaps** where people live far from major roads
- **Opportunity zones** for new transport infrastructure

## ‚ö° Performance

- **First request**: ~5-10 seconds (downloads OSM data)
- **Cached data**: OSMnx caches downloads locally
- **Subsequent requests**: Much faster!

## üé® Frontend Impact

The 3D visualization will now show **real transport access patterns**:
- Red zones: Areas with genuinely poor road connectivity
- Green zones: Areas with dense road networks
- Click any zone to see actual road density statistics

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

**Library**: OSMnx 1.9.4 (by Geoff Boeing)
**Data Source**: OpenStreetMap API (Overpass)
**Network Type**: 'drive' (motorized vehicle roads)
**Analysis**: Spatial intersection + length calculations
**Output**: 0-1 normalized score per grid cell
