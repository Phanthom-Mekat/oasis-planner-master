## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 1: Data Processing (Day 1)

```javascript
// Google Earth Engine Script (Copy-Paste Ready)
var dhaka = ee.Geometry.Rectangle([90.2, 23.5, 90.6, 23.9]);

// Load key datasets
var population = ee.ImageCollection("WorldPop/GP/100m/pop")
  .filter(ee.Filter.eq('country', 'BGD'))
  .filter(ee.Filter.eq('year', 2020))
  .first().clip(dhaka);

var no2 = ee.ImageCollection("COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_NO2")
  .select('NO2_column_number_density')
  .filterDate('2024-06-01', '2024-08-31')
  .filterBounds(dhaka).mean().clip(dhaka);

var nightlights = ee.ImageCollection("NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMCFG")
  .select('avg_rad')
  .filterDate('2024-01-01', '2024-08-31')
  .mean().clip(dhaka);

// Export for web use
Export.image.toDrive({
  image: population.addBands(no2).addBands(nightlights),
  description: 'dhaka_combined_analysis',
  scale: 500,
  region: dhaka
});
```

"Dhaka is home to 22 million people, growing by 3.5% annually, with air pollution 3 times WHO standards. How can NASA Earth observation data help urban planners make evidence-based decisions for sustainable growth?"

### Technical Credibility (30 seconds)
"We integrated 6 NASA datasets - TROPOMI for air quality, SEDAC for population, MODIS for land use - with partner data from Copernicus and WorldPop to create neighborhood-level vulnerability assessments."

### Demo Impact (90 seconds)
Show live dashboard with click-through analysis of Dhaka neighborhoods, highlighting specific recommendations with population impact numbers.

### Scaling Potential (30 seconds)
"This framework can be replicated for any rapidly growing city worldwide, providing city planners with actionable insights from freely available NASA Earth observation data."
